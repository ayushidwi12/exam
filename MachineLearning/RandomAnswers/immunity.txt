1. "The immune system's active response to pathogens involves the activation of specialized cells called macrophages, which engulf and digest foreign substances, and the production of signaling molecules called cytokines, which coordinate the immune response."
2. "The mechanisms that lead to active immunity involve the recognition of pathogens by T cells, which then proliferate and differentiate into effector cells that eliminate infected cells or produce cytokines that activate other immune cells. In contrast, passive immunity results from the transfer of pre-existing antibodies from an immune individual to a nonimmune individual."
3. "Active immunity involves the activation of B cells, which produce antibodies that recognize and neutralize pathogens. These antibodies can also activate complement proteins, which further contribute to the immune response. Passive immunity, on the other hand, involves the transfer of pre-existing antibodies from an immune individual to a nonimmune individual."
4. "The immune system's active response to pathogens involves the activation of dendritic cells, which present antigens to T cells and activate the adaptive immune response. Passive immunity involves the transfer of pre-existing antibodies from an immune individual to a nonimmune individual, bypassing the need for an adaptive immune response."
5. "Active immunity involves the activation of natural killer cells, which recognize and eliminate infected cells or produce cytokines that activate other immune cells. Passive immunity results from the transfer of pre-existing immunity from an immune individual to a nonimmune individual."
6. "The mechanisms that lead to active immunity involve the recognition of pathogens by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on antigen-presenting cells, which then activate the adaptive immune response. Passive immunity involves the transfer of pre-existing immunity from an immune individual to a nonimmune individual, without the need for an adaptive immune response."
7. "Active immunity involves the activation of cytotoxic T cells, which recognize and eliminate infected cells or produce cytokines that activate other immune cells. Passive immunity results from the transfer of pre-existing antibodies from an immune individual to a nonimmune individual."
8. "The immune system's active response to pathogens involves the activation of T helper cells, which differentiate into different subtypes and coordinate the immune response. Passive immunity involves the transfer of pre-existing immunity from an immune individual to a nonimmune individual."
9. "Active immunity involves the activation of regulatory T cells, which suppress immune responses and prevent autoimmune diseases. Passive immunity results from the transfer of pre-existing immunity from an immune individual to a nonimmune individual."
10. "The mechanisms that lead to active immunity involve the recognition of pathogens by T cells, which then activate the adaptive immune response. Passive immunity involves the transfer of pre-existing immunity from an immune individual to a nonimmune individual, without the need for an adaptive immune response."
