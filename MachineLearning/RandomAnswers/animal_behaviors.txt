1. "The development of complex behaviors in animals is a result of a delicate balance between genetics and environment. For instance, a foal's genetic predisposition to run with its herd is influenced by the availability of grasslands and the presence of predators."
2. "Behavioral development in animals is often influenced by epigenetic factors, which can be triggered by environmental cues. For example, a beaver's genetic propensity to build dams may be activated by the presence of water in its environment."
3. "The expression of genes involved in complex behaviors is often regulated by gene regulatory networks, which are influenced by environmental stimuli. For example, a mouse's genetic predisposition to fear a particular smell may be triggered by the presence of that smell in its environment."
4. "The interaction between genes and the environment is a dynamic one, with each influencing the other in a complex feedback loop. For instance, a chimpanzee's genetic predisposition to use tools may be influenced by the availability of suitable materials in its environment."
5. "Behavioral development in animals is often the result of a trade-off between different genetic pathways. For example, a salmon's genetic predisposition to migrate may be influenced by the availability of food in its environment."
6. "The expression of genes involved in complex behaviors is often influenced by the age and experience of the animal. For example, a dog's genetic predisposition to bark at strangers may be triggered by its exposure to new environments."
7. "The interaction between genes and the environment is mediated by a complex network of hormonal and neurotransmitter signals. For instance, a bee's genetic predisposition to communicate through dance may be triggered by the presence of pheromones in its environment."
8. "Behavioral development in animals is often influenced by the social environment, with genetic factors playing a secondary role. For example, a lion's genetic predisposition to form a pride may be influenced by the presence of other lions in its environment."
9. "The expression of genes involved in complex behaviors is often influenced by the animal's emotional state. For example, a cat's genetic predisposition to purr may be triggered by its emotional response to touch."
10. "The interaction between genes and the environment is a critical factor in shaping the evolution of complex behaviors in animals. For instance, a bird's genetic predisposition to migrate may be influenced by the availability of suitable habitats in its environment."
